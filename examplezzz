# --------
1. Refactor Base and InputObject, FieldDefinition and InputFieldDefinition to combine shared-logic [in progress]
2. Implement can :mutate and can :query (aliases), can :input [in progress]
3. Add mutation support to Visitor [done]
4. Add mutation root option to Runner [done]
5. Switch to 8.0 (GodMutation for menu_item)
---
6. Introspection fix-up and additions
7. Update visitor to not convert any user inputted values to symbols
8. Fragment on <type> does not currently validate <type>. Validate it.
9. Move Visitor#resolve_fragments to Builder#resolve_fragments
10. Finish interfaces implementation (grep for TODO:)
11. Fragments on arbitrary constant names should not cause Rails to try and load that constant.
In other words fragment type lookups in the visitor should be based on a whitelist of all the types nested in the Root Prototypes
instead of using RailsQL::Type::KlassFactory.
12. plural args

More Features
* Type Name Introspection (__typename field on all types)
* Variables
  - order of variable definitions, how does visitor handle it?
    - must be defined at the top of an operation
    - actually, runner needs to handle resolving variables
      (in case the value of a var is based on a previous operation in the document)
      - visitor generates builders (one tree per operation)
      - for each operation/builder tree:
        - resolve builder vars (see below)
        - resolve builders to data types
        - run query and resolve models
        - update vars
  - variables in fragments?
    - yes, but var must be defined at the top of any operation which references that fragment
  - can you share vars across multiple operations?
    - no
  - are vars always scalars or can they be objects?
    - can be any type of input
  - how would you handle resolving variables with recursive input object values?
    - add arg to everywhere the variable is referenced
  - can you reference a variable within a variable's input object value?
    - no. Because variable values come through a side channel and are not GraphQL
* List and Non-Null as standalone anonomous types + syntax for fields
* Directives
* Field Aliases
  - breaks sequel gem model querying
  - in railsQL, just use the alias name as the field key in type
    - eg: RootType has fields user_1: Field(name: "user"), user_2: Field(name: "user")

Potential Resolve Builder Var solution :
class Builder
  def resolve_variables!(variable_values)
    @unresolved_variables.each do |k|
      add_arg k, variable_values[k]
    end
    child_builders.each{|b| b.resolve_variables! variables_values}
  end
end

(in runner, run after each operation [if we allow more than one operation]):
roots = visitor.root_builders.map do |root_builder|
  root_builder.resolve_variables! variables
  root = root_builder.type
  root.build_query!
  root.resolve_child_types!
  update_variables!
  root
end
